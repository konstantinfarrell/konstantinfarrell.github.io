# There Was a Change

Things aren't quite how they used to be. And that is very annoying for some. At least,
it was for me when I went to do the thing and found out that the thing didn't quite
work as I had originally expected it to. Naturally, I did what any sensible developer in
my situation would do: Immediately began complaining to my coworkers about it.

As usual, this failed to produce anything other than annoyed grunts from my ever-patient
colleagues. So I decided to actually attempt to fix the problem.

Thus, this disorganized and incomplete list of changes in CentOS 7 was born.

For both my benefit and yours. But not Sean's. He knows what he did.

## Wheres My Service

First thing that I noticed was the service commands changing. Back in CentOS 6, commands
like `service httpd restart` or `service postgres restart` would work just fine.
Now the same commands throw a warning. This is because CentOS is pushing to change from
`init` to `systemd`. There are many reasons for this. A great explanation can be found
[here](http://www.tecmint.com/systemd-replaces-init-in-linux/).

The commands that are taking all the jobs are controlled by `systemctl` now.

So

    service httpd restart

Would change to

    systemctl restart httpd

This effects services like `httpd`, `mysql`, `postgresql`, `redis` and more.
A comprehensive tutorial of `systemd` commands can be found
[here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units)

## IPTables Have Turned

`iptables` has been replaced with `firewalld`.

This is a real pain to find out if you're in a hurry trying to get a project running.
Back in the day you could do

    iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT
    /sbin/service iptables save

and it would set you up for a local project. That's not the case anymore. The equivalent in
`firewalld` is as follows

    firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=http/tcp
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=http/tcp --permanent

Just a little bit more readable.
