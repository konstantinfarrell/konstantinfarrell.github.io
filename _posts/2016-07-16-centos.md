# There Was a Change

Things aren't quite how they used to be. And that is very annoying for some. At least,
it was for me when I went to do the thing and found out that the thing didn't quite
work as I had originally expected it to. Naturally, I did what any sensible developer in
my situation would do: Immediately began complaining to my coworkers about it.

As usual, this failed to produce anything other than annoyed grunts from my ever-patient
colleagues. So I decided to actually attempt to fix the problem.

Thus, this disorganized and incomplete list of changes in CentOS 7 was born.

For both my benefit and yours. But not Sean's. He knows what he did.

## Wheres My Service

First thing that I noticed was the service commands changing. Back in CentOS 6, commands
like `service httpd restart` or `service postgres restart` would work just fine.
Now the same commands throw a warning.

The commands that are taking all the jobs are controlled by `systemctl` now.

So

    service httpd restart

Would change to

    systemctl restart httpd

This effects services like `httpd`, `mysql`, `postgresql`, `redis` and more.
