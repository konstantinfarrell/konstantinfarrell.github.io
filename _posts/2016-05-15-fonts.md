It took a little bit of digging to find this one, so I'm posting it for future reference.

If you happen to be running CentOS 7 in headless mode on an AMD processor (can you say niche?)
and have wanted to change the system font family or size, look no further than `terminus-fonts-console`.
It's a pretty neat little utility that does it all for you.

First install it with `yum`, then set the system font to whatever you like. The supported font types
are listed on their package [site](https://pkgs.org/centos-6/centos-i386/terminus-fonts-console-4.30-1.el6.noarch.rpm.html).

In my case, I wanted a bigger font, so I used `ter-d22b`

    yum install terminus-fonts-console
    setfont ter-d22b.psf.gz
    echo setfont ter-d22b.psf.gz >> /etc/rc.local

This may not apply to you, but in my case it did as I was using a fresh install of CentOS.

Make sure you set the executable bit.

    chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local

And just like that your new system font is ready to go.
