# Computers Are Fast

Like...REALLY FAST. Despite how long it may have taken you to load this page,
the computer you are using is an incredibly fast machine. Did I mention it's fast?

Humans, on the other hand, are slow. We think slow. We are error prone. Programmers
can spend weeks writing code that will compile and run within a millisecond.
It can be aggravating to spend so long on a feature, then go to run it and
be faced with a wall of error messages at runtime. Whats worse is these errors
show up almost instantly. At least engineers have the satisfaction of watching
something physical crumble and fall to pieces. Programmers just get a wall of unexpected text.
This can result in feelings ranging from disappointment to coffee-spilling rage.



# So Wat Do

Well. For starters. Slow down. A lot. Go grab a coffee before running that code.
Check everything twice before leaving though. Don't rush. Write stuff down on paper.

And when there's an error message, READ IT.
