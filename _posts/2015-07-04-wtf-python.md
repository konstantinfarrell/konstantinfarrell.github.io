## I've got Idle installed. I made it say "Hello, World!". What now?

As someone who works with Python every day, this sort of question seems like a no-brainer. Like Java, there are modules and libraries for almost any concievable task. And unlike Java, the language is really easy to keep clean and simple. It has plugins for several other languages, and can be run on all operating systems, provided they have that version of python installed. So what's the big deal? Why is Python so hard to find a use for?

The truth is, it's not. Thinking back to the days of lower-division computer science classes, I remember wondering to myself why anyone would want to use Java, when C++ was so much faster, and allowed you to do so many more things. Then I tried to make a user interface in C++.


### Have you ever tried to make a user interface in C++? Fuck that.


That really got me thinking about the use of different languages for different things.
