# I recently saw an interview where Elon Musk and Bill Gates got all scared.

Ok, they weren't all scared. Scared isn't the best word for it. Highly concerned would be a better way to describe it. Primarily, their concerns lied in our rapid research and production of artificial intelligence, and the possibility of artificial intelligence going all "angsty-teen" on us and not wanting to be related anymore.

More seriously, what would happen if AI suddenly decided that humans were too dangerous to keep around?

Now before you just brush this off as the subject of a lot of bad sci-fi, consider the following. Since the introduction of the world wide web in the 1990's, mankind has been digitizing every form of information we can get our hands on. From medical records to baby pictures, music to math formulas, every little bit of information we as humans consider useful has been transcribed and digitized, then placed in the world wide closet of information for later use.
