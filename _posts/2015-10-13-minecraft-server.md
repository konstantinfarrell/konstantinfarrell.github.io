# Lets Play Some Minecraft

So I know I've been promising to set up a Minecraft server for my friends for a while now,
and I'm finally getting around to getting it done. Be proud of me. This is a big achievement.

I should note, as this is a public page, that if you do not have any idea why I am suddenly posting
about Minecraft, you should probably just ignore this and move on. The only people allowed on the
server are those I know personally.

### Background

Up until recently, this server has been dedicated to building Plum Town. If you would like to contribute to Plum Town (it does still need a few things), please consult 'tori.
Any unauthorized building will be deleted & any destruction of the Plum Town will result in a mental & emotional breakdown for 'tori - so please don't.

There have been many changes since the server first started.

- Survival and Adventure mode are now supported, instead of just Creative.
- Zones have been setup for each different game mode.
- The original server OS has been replaced with a far more capable OS, reducing overall lag.
- The spawn area has moved from the center of Plum Town to a special "Spawn Zone" where users can utilize teleporters to set their game mode, and transport them to the respective area.
- The number of mods has increased from 3 to 12.

#### SCHEDULE

**The server will be running from 12:00PM to 1:00AM every day.**

# Requirements

There are a few things you're going to need before you will be able to connect, as we aren't running a vanilla server. Mods are fun.

You should have Minecraft 1.8 installed. Below are the additional items for you to download and instructions for proper installation etc...

# Install (for Windows)

In the following instructions, replace `username` with your Windows username.
If one of the listed folders does not exist in your minecraft directory, simply create a new folder with that name.

#### First download the dependencies

- [Forge Modloader](../../../../files/server/forge/forge-1.8-11.14.1.1334-installer-win.exe)
    - Open the Forge installer and following the instructions to "install client".
        - **NOTE:** If you are also installing minecraft for the first time you will need to edit your profile such that the dropdown menu in the "Version Selection" box is set to 1.8
        - You will also need to launch minecraft (start/load a game) at least once to avoid getting an installation error from Forge.
    - Open Minecraft Launcher, select the 'Forge' profile, and start Minecraft
    - Once you see the menu screen, exit Minecraft
- [LiteLoader Installer](../../../../files/server/mods/liteloader-installer-1.8.0.exe)
    - Open and choose to "extend from" the Forge profile then install
    - Open Minecraft Launcher using the 'LiteLoader with Forge' profile
    - Once you see the menu screen, exit Minecraft
- [Zipped Mods Folder](../../../../files/server/mods/1.8.zip)
    - Unzip and place the "1.8" file folder in the mods directory (`C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods`)
    - Your (\.minecraft\mods\1.8) folder should contain .jar/.litemod files for the mods listed above
- [Worldedit Config Files](../../../../files/server/config/worldedit.zip)
    - Unzip & place the "worldedit" file folder in the config directory (`C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\config`)
- [Resource Pack](../../../../files/server/resourcepacks/Crafteryada v0.9.3a.zip) (optional - slower computers may want to skip)
    - Place the Crafteryada v0.9.3a.zip file in the resourcepacks directory (`C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks`)
    - Note: Plum Town was created using this pack & you are welcome to use it, but don't feel obligated to. ("But it makes Plum Town look damn fine" *-'tori*). If you have any cool Resource Packs, please share them with the group.

#### Then configure Minecraft

- Start up the Minecraft Launcher & make sure you have the 'LiteLoader with Forge' profile selected
- I highly suggest you allocate more RAM by selecting "Edit Profile" and changing the number in the "JVM Arguments" field (at the bottom) to the number of gigs (of RAM) you want Minecraft to use. For example, I wanted to use 4 gigs, so mine says: -Xmx4G
- Start up minecraft. In the settings menu, select `options > resource packs > Crafteryada v0.9.3a.zip`
- Make sure everything's working out, save, and exit.

## Get Approved

All that is left for you to do now is get your account whitelisted so you can have access to the server. Send an email to <konstantinfarrell@gmail.com> with your first and last name, and account name.
I will respond with the server criteria when you have been approved. If we are connected on Facebook, I will also add you to the group page where I post updates regarding server downtimes and IP address changes.

## Further Reading

If you would like to do your homework, here is a list of the mods currently installed on the server.
