# Lets play some Minecraft

So I know I've been promising to set up a Minecraft server for my friends for a while now, 
and I'm finally getting around to getting it done. Be proud of me. This is a big achievement.

I should note, as this is a public page, that if you do not have any idea why I am suddenly posting
about Minecraft, you should probably just ignore this and move on. The only people allowed on the
server are those I know personally.


## Objective

The server's purpose is to re-create Pflaumbaumbedorf (spelling?). Aka Plum Town. The setting
in which the 7th Sea Adventure we played took place. Currently this is the only purpose for the map.
Other objectives may be added in the future, but must be approved before they can be built.

## Rules

- No griefing.
- No modification of other people's creations without their approval.
- No hacking. Seriously I will ban you so fast.
- No loitering. Mostly because I don't want to have the server running for people who aren't doing anything.

## Requirements

You should have minecraft installed. You will also need a few mods to work with the server. They are listed here.

- [Forge](../files/server/mods)


## Instructions

- Download the listed mods.
- Install the mods by placing them in the mods directory (`C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods` for Windows)
