# Lets play some Minecraft

So I know I've been promising to set up a Minecraft server for my friends for a while now, 
and I'm finally getting around to getting it done. Be proud of me. This is a big achievement.

I should note, as this is a public page, that if you do not have any idea why I am suddenly posting
about Minecraft, you should probably just ignore this and move on. The only people allowed on the
server are those I know personally.

# READ THIS ITS IMPORTANT

For now, this server is dedicated to building Plum Town. If you would like to add something else, please consult one of the admins ('tori or Konstantin) first.
Any unauthorized building will be deleted without warning. 

Here is a [map](../../../../files/server/img/map.jpg) of plum town done by Remi and 'tori.

## Requirements

There are a few things you're going to need before you will be able to connect, as we aren't running a vanilla server. Mods are fun.

You should have Minecraft 1.8 (the latest version) installed. You will also need to download the following.

- [Forge Modloader](../../../../files/server/forge/forge-1.8-11.14.1.1334-installer-win.exe)
- [Zipped Mods Folder](../../../../files/server/mods/1.8.zip)
- [Worldedit Config Files](../../../../files/server/config/worldedit.zip)
- [Resource Packs](../../../../files/server/resourcepacks/Crafteryada v0.9.3a.zip)


## Install (for Windows)

In the following instructions, replace `username` with your Windows username. If one of the listed folders does not exist in your minecraft directory, simply create a new folder with that name.

- Download the listed mods.
- First install Forge by double clicking the installer and following the instructions.
- Next unzip the 1.8.zip file, and place the contents in the mods directory (`C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods`)
- Unzip the worldedit.zip file and place the unzipped folder in the config directory (`C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\config`)
- Place the Crafteryada v0.9.3a.zip file in the resourcepacks directory (`C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks`)

That ought to do it for dependencies.

- Now start up minecraft, and set the profile to "Forge"
- In the settings menu, select `options > resource packs > Crafteryada v0.9.3a.zip`
- Save and exit.

## Get Approved

All that is left for you to do now is get your account whitelisted so you can have access to the server. Send an email to <konstantinfarrell@gmail.com> with your first and last name, and account name.
I will respond with the server criteria when you have been approved.
