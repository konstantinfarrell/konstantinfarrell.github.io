# Lets play some Minecraft

So I know I've been promising to set up a Minecraft server for my friends for a while now, 
and I'm finally getting around to getting it done. Be proud of me. This is a big achievement.

I should note, as this is a public page, that if you do not have any idea why I am suddenly posting
about Minecraft, you should probably just ignore this and move on. The only people allowed on the
server are those I know personally.

# READ THIS ITS IMPORTANT

Up untill recently, this server has been deddicated to building Plum Town. If you would like to contribute to Plum Town (it does still need a few things), please consult 'tori. Any unauthorized building will be deleted & any destruction of the Plum Town will result in a mental & emotional breakdown for 'tori - so please don't.

Join the Facebook group. I post important updates there including current the ip addreses.

# GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!

There is now a deddicated machine to run the server, named Tardigrade. It's set up to automatically run noon-1am, if you'd like to play outside those times, let me know & I'll set it up.

Also, we've moved on to other exciting ventures now! We are building grand things, still primarily in creative - however, I have set up adventure & survival mode zones if you prefer to play there. Be aware that if you choose to leave creative mode, you won't be able to switch back to creative without me. Working on it.

## Requirements

There are a few things you're going to need before you will be able to connect, as we aren't running a vanilla server. Mods are fun.

Update: More mods have been added to the server! World Edit, VoxelMap, NotEnoughItems, Storage Drawers, Advanced Inventory, Gems, Useful Food, Plant Mega Pack, Custom NPCs, Animal Plus, Progressive Automation, and Hopper Ducts. You may not have access to all the mods, so if there's one you'd like to use, let me know & I'll make sure you can.

You should have Minecraft 1.8 installed. Below are the additional items for you to download and instructions for proper installation etc...

## Install (for Windows)

In the following instructions, replace `username` with your Windows username. If one of the listed folders does not exist in your minecraft directory, simply create a new folder with that name.

- [Forge Modloader](../../../../files/server/forge/forge-1.8-11.14.1.1334-installer-win.exe)
    - Open the Forge installer and following the instructions to "install client".
    - Open Minecraft Launcher, select the 'Forge' profile, and start Minecraft
    - Once you see the menu screen, exit Minecraft
- [LiteLoader Installer](../../../../files/server/mods/liteloader-installer-1.8.0.exe)
    - Open and choose to "extend from" the Forge profile then install
    - Open Minecraft Launcher using the 'LiteLoader with Forge' profile
    - Once you see the menu screen, exit Minecraft
- [Zipped Mods Folder](../../../../files/server/mods/1.8.zip)
    - Unzip and place the "1.8" file folder in the mods directory (`C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods`)
    - Your (\.minecraft\mods\1.8) folder should contain .jar/.litemod files for: Optifine, WorldEdit, and Zan's MiniMap
- [Worldedit Config Files](../../../../files/server/config/worldedit.zip)
    - Unzip & place the "worldedit" file folder in the config directory (`C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\config`)
- [Resource Pack](../../../../files/server/resourcepacks/Crafteryada v0.9.3a.zip) (optional - slower computers may want to skip)
    - Place the Crafteryada v0.9.3a.zip file in the resourcepacks directory (`C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks`)
    - Note: Plum Town was created using this pack & you are welcome to use it, but don't feel obligated to. ("But it makes Plum Town look damn fine" *-'tori*). If you have any cool Resource Packs, please share them with the group.

That ought to do it for dependencies.

- Now start up Minecraft Launcher & make sure you have the 'LiteLoader with Forge' profile selected
- I highly suggest you allocate more RAM by selecting "Edit Profile" and changing the number in the "JVM Arguments" field (at the bottom) to the number of gigs (of RAM) you want Minecraft to use. For example, I wanted to use 4 gigs, so mine says: -Xmx4G
- Start up minecraft. In the settings menu, select `options > resource packs > Crafteryada v0.9.3a.zip`
- Make sure everything's working out, save, and exit.

## Get Approved

All that is left for you to do now is get your account whitelisted so you can have access to the server. Send an email to <konstantinfarrell@gmail.com> with your first and last name, and account name.
I will respond with the server criteria when you have been approved.

### Check back soon!

I will be posting updates to this frequently.
