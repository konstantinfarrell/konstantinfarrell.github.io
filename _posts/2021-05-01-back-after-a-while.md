# 5 years

I honestly can't believe it's been almost 5 years since I've updated this blog. I'll keep it short and sweet for now.

#### A lot has happened in that time

To summarize, I started my first real software job. Got promoted. The company I work for got acquired. Eventually the companies merged together but not without several hurdles. I've lead a team, I've spoken with clients and customers. I've spent hours on the phone with AWS debugging infrastructure issues. I've spent hours on the phone with team members coaching them through programming and career hurdles.

But most importantly, I've learned a lot.

I intend to share as much of what I have learned as I can within this space. 
But for now, I just want to say thank you for reading, and I'm happy to be back.
