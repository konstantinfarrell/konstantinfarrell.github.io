## Before you begin

You gotta know a few things about whats going on on this page. First, this guide is a quickstart so don't expect a detailed explanation of anything less than criticaly important. 
Second, I write Python for web applications. So what I consider "the basics" may not be what you're looking for (though if you're a total beginner, you may get some use out of it).
Third, notice the date. 'murka. Aight, lets hop on our eagles and write some patriotic Python.
