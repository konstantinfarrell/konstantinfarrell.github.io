## Before you begin

You gotta know a few things about whats going on on this page. First, this guide is a quickstart so don't expect a detailed explanation of anything less than criticaly important. 
Second, I write Python for web applications. So what I consider "the basics" may not be what you're looking for (though if you're a total beginner, you may get some use out of it).
Third, notice the date. 'murka. Aight, lets hop on our eagles and write some patriotic Python.

## Getting Started

You should have some sort of Python environment installed. You can use the terminal and a text editor like Vim to write and execute Python code, or you could use an IDE like Idle, or PyCharm.
I will focus primarily on running Python in a Linux based Terminal environment. If you're using Idle or some other IDE, you can skip to the next section.

Also I use Vim. Sorry Emacs users.

### Download & Install - Linux

Lets start by downloading, and installing the version of Python we are going to be using.

    wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.6/Python-3.3.6.tar.xz
    tar xf Python-3.*
    cd Python-3.*
    ./configure
    make

If you're running a version of Red Hat, or use yum, use

    make altinstall

otherwise

    make install

Once that is all finished, you should have python ready to go.

### Download & Install - Windows & Mac

If you arent running a linux distribution, or just don't want to hastle with the command line then you can install Idle for free from Python's website. 

[www.python.org/downloads](http://www.python.org/downloads/)

Download and install Python 3.4.3, and open Idle once it's finished.

## Open a new Python file

For terminal users, cd to your working directory & open a new Python using

    vim new_file.py

or if you're using Idle,

    <ctrl> + n


## Some Handy Stuff to Know

Comments in Python are done like this

    # either with a "#"
    """
        or as a block
        comment spanning
        multiple lines.
        You can use both
        single and double
        quotes for block
        comments
    """

### Input / Output

You can output to the terminal with

    print("Hello, world!")

Variable data types are implicit, so no type declaration is needed

    my_variable = "Set it to a string"
    another = 5
    yet_another = False

If you want to get user input, use the `input()` function and assign it to a variable.

    user_input = input("Say something!")
    print(str(user_input))

Make sure to always sanitize your input and output to avoid errors.

    output = my_variable + str(another)
    print(output) # => "Set it to a string5"

There are also several handy string operations like

    len(output)         # => 19 - the length of the string
    output.split(" ")   # => "Set", "it", "to", "a", "string5"
    output[0]           # => "S"

### Control Flow

Python comes equipped with all the bells and whistles you need to make your program run. Thanks to Python's focus on readability, control flow statements read exactly how they work.

if / else statements

    a = 3
    b = 5
    if a < b:
        print(str(a) + " is less than " + str(b))
    elif a > b:
        print(str(b) + " is less than " + str(a))
    else:
        print("They are equal")

for loops

    list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for entry in list:      # note that the iterator variable
        print(str(entry))   # declaration statement is implicit

and while loops

    count = 0
    full = 20
    while count <= full:
        print(str(count))
        count++


That should be enough to get you started. If you feel like I've missed something, please email me and I'll make changes as necessary. Again, this is a rough guide, and is not meant for people who have never programmed before. There are better, more comprehensive guides out there that would be far more beneficial to you.
