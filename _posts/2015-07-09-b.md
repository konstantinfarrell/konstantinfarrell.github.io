# b'Python3 does this'

Occasionally you have to fix some weird encoding issue when dealing with file I/O.
One of the problems I've run into frequently involves the b''. It's annoying when I forget how to fix it.
Luckily I remembered.
So here's how you fix it

    # get whatever variable contains the annoying b''. I'll call it encoded.
    >> encoded = b'aww man why is this happening again'
    >> type(encoded)

    <class 'bytes'>

    >> print(encoded)

    b'aww man why is this happening again'

    >> decoded = encoded.decode("utf-8")
    >> type(decoded)

    <class 'str'>

    >> print(decoded)

    aww man why is this happening again

### You're welcome. Now make it go.
