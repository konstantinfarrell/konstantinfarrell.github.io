## My name is Konstantin. I make things go.

I'm a Python programmer with a lot of web experience. I've done front end work in javascript and html/css
as well as back end work using frameworks like Django, Flask and Tornado as well as good ol' php and mysql.

Currently I work with an amazing team at [Cylance](http://cylance.com) writing some sweet code while
making lame jokes.

My hobbies include writing code, creating music or art, tinkering with electronics,
building and inventing.
