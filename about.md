## My name is Konstantin. I make things go.

I'm a Python programmer, web developer, and a student at Portland State University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
I've done work in a variety of languages, including:

- Python
- C/C++
- JavaScript
- PHP
- C#/.NET
- Java
- Bash
- HTML/CSS/SASS
- SQL/MySQL/PostgreSQL

My hobbies include writing code, creating music or art, tinkering with electronics and
building and inventing.
I love to put my creative skills to use and I'm always up for finding more opportunities to do so.
