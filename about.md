## My name is Konstantin. I make things go.

I'm a cloud engineer with lots of experience in high-performance, scaleable, security-driven backend web API development.

I'm language agnostic but love working with Python, Rust, or Golang.

Currently I work with an amazing team at [Cylance](http://cylance.com) giving life to our flagship product: CylancePROTECT.

My hobbies include writing code, creating music or art, tinkering with electronics,
building and inventing.
