## My name is Konstantin. I make things go.

My inventory of languages includes:

- Python
- C/C++
- Bash
- PHP
- C#/.NET
- Java
- JavaScript/jQuery
- HTML/CSS/SASS
- SQL/MySQL/PostgreSQL

And I am also proficient in the following frameworks:

- Jekyll

I currently work at Portland State University's department for Academic and Research Computing.
We develop, host, and maintain custom, data-driven research web applications for the university
and other clients. Currently, we maintain and provide support for over 100 applications spanning
many widely-used frameworks.

My hobbies include writing code, creating music or art, tinkering with electronics and
building and inventing.
I love to put my creative skills to use and I'm always up for finding more opportunities to do so.
