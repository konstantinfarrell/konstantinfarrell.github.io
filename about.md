## My name is Konstantin. I make things go.

I'm a student at Portland State University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
I've done work in a variety of languages, including:

- Python
- C/C++
- JavaScript
- PHP
- C#/.NET
- Java
- Bash
- HTML/CSS/SASS
- SQL/MySQL/PostgreSQL

I currently work at Portland State University's department for Academic and Research Computing. (Until June 30th)
We develop, host, and maintain custom, data-driven research web applications for the university and other clients.
Currently, we maintain and provide support for over 100 applications spanning many widely-used frameworks.

During my time here I've built applications using Python and the Django Framework, and PHP/LAMP stack.

My hobbies include writing code, creating music or art, tinkering with electronics and
building and inventing.
I love to put my creative skills to use and I'm always up for finding more opportunities to do so.
