## My name is Konstantin. I make things go.

I currently work at Portland State University's department for Academic and Research Computing. We write, host, and maintain custom web applications for the university and other clients.

I really like code, space, engineering, and making things go. Whether it's that last stinkin' bug that managed to elude me for this long, or it's that critical component that allows the rocket to safely deploy its parachute at its apogee. Let me take a crack at it.

While I am currently employed, I have lots of free afternoons to do stuff with. If you have a site that needs to be redone, a buggy module that could use a second pair of eyes, or a rocket that really wants to get to space, let me know.
