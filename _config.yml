    Konstantin is a full-stack web developer from Portland, Oregon.
    In his spare time he can be found tinkering away at some code or
    circuits, making music on whatever instrument he can find, or
    hacking away at about 4 projects at once.
    He also occasionally has a decent game of DotA.
